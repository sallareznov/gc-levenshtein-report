The algorithm is implemented in the following languages (in alphabetical order) :
\begin{multicols}{2}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item C
		\item Go
		\item Haskell
		\item Java
		\item Ocaml
		\item Python
		\item Ruby
		\item Scala
	\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}

The measurements of energy footprints is done thanks to PowerAPI \cite{powerapi-website}\cite{powerapi-github}, a middleware toolkit for software-defined power meters.

The GitHub repository containing the implementations in the different languages and the results (the files generated by PowerAPI) can be found at the following link : \url{https://github.com/sallareznov/gc-levenshtein}.

In order to have relevant evaluations, the different program follow the same logic, down to the last semicolon.
