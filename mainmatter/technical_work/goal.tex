    My goal is to measure energy footprints of different programming languages through execution of programs executing the same task. The results of this experiment can be very beneficial for many people in specific domains, especially in two. First, developers who tend to favour energy-efficiency over performance will know how language to use to produce the most economical program possible. Second, language designers can analyse the metrics and reach conclusions on how a design of a language can be improved or rewritten.
