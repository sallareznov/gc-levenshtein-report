	Information and Communications Technology devices usage is increasing, resulting in a growing complexity of modern processors \cite{ict}. Therefore, software power estimation is very important in this context, enabling architecture-agnostic solutions to leverage this power metric.
	 
	 Even on the software side, when writing a program, the best choice is to be made (i.e the one with the best energy consumption). That is what this project tackles : energy consumption of languages executing the same algorithm.
	 
	 In this project, a study consisting of a comparison of algorithms performance is presented. The algorithm is implemented and executed in 7 languages, and their energy consumption are measured and compared.
